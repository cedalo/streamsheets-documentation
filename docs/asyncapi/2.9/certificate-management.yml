  version: 2.9.1
  description: |
    Manage Certificate Authorities (CAs) used for client certificate based
    authentication. The topic of the plugin's control API is
    `$CONTROL/certificate-management/v1`.

    Currently supported commands offered by the API are `insertCACertificate`,
    which can be used to extend the known Certificate Authorities (CAs). To
    delete an existing CA the `deleteCACertificate` command can be used.
