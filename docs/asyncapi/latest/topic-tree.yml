  version: 3.0.0
  description: |
    This plugin provides information on currently in use topics on the broker,
    from both published messages and from subscriptions.

    The topic of the plugin's control API is `$CONTROL/cedalo/topictree/v1`.

    Currently supported commands offered by the API are `topicCount` to get a
    count of publish and subscribe topics, `listTopics` to get the list of
    in-use topics, `setTtl` to set the number of seconds until a a topic is
    considered unused, `addFilter` to add a filter so that only certain topics
    are considered, `removeFilter` to remove a filter, `clearFilters` to remove
    all filters, `listFilters` to retrieve the currently configured filters,
    `getLimits` to read topic/payload limits and `setLimits` to set topic/payload
    limits.
