For instance, a message that arrives at a Mosquitto broker can be relayed to one or multiple topics within the Google Pub/Sub service.

Each insert can contain the fields payload, jsonPayload, topic, qos, clientid, hostname, retain, timestamp of the received MQTT message. By default, all these fields are included in the database insert command. If needed, Schema mappings_ are used to filter or rename these fields.
