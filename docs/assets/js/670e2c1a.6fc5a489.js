This interoperability supports various messaging patterns, including 1n, and n:1, as dictated by the designated topic mappings. For instance, a message that arrives at a Mosquitto broker can be relayed to one or multiple topics within the Google Pub/Sub service. Similarly, a Mosquitto broker can fetch messages from one or more Google Pub/Sub topics and distribute them to one or several MQTT topics. For further details, refer to the example configuration.","sidebar":"someSidebar"},"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-http-bridge":{"id":"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-http-bridge","title":"HTTP Bridge","description":"The purpose of the HTTP Bridge is to bridge data messages between the Mosquitto MQTT broker and a HTTP Webserver. With the current version the user may forward incoming MQTT messages to a HTTP Webserver using REST calls. Each webserver, which should be addressed by the HTTP Bridge, is configured using a remote definition. For each remote definition multiple mappings from a MQTT topic to a HTTP URL may be defined. For each message published to the configured topic the corresponding webservice will be invoked forwarding the MQTT messages as the Webservice body.","sidebar":"someSidebar"},"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-kafka-bridge":{"id":"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-kafka-bridge","title":"Kafka Bridge","description":"The Kafka Bridge plugin can be used to publish data published to the Mosquitto","sidebar":"someSidebar"},"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-mongodb-bridge":{"id":"broker/Mosquitto Manual/Bridges/mosquitto-mongodb-bridge","title":"MongoDB Bridge","description":"The MongoDB-Bridge plugin can be used to insert data published to the Mosquitto broker into a MongoDB database. The plugin can handle multiple MongoDB client connections. Each connection applies changes to a configured database. Currently, the integrated client supports only basic authentication (username, password). Topic mappings are used to specify which MQTT topic payloads should be inserted into which collection. Each insert can contain the fields payload, topic, qos, clientid, hostname, retain, timestamp of the received MQTT message. By default, all these fields are included in the database insert command. If needed, Schema mappings_ are used to filter or rename these fields. The queueSize can be configured per MongoDB client, to specify a limit of not-yet-processed MQTT messages, before the plugin starts to drop them.
