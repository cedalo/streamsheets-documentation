## Port Allocation

**What are ports?**

Ports handle communication over the internet, they make sure, that there
are no conflicts in data transmission. All data transmitted over the
internet is sent and received by using different kinds of protocols.
Each protocol is assigned a specific port number. This way data streams
can easily be managed and adjusted.

**Which ports are allocated by Streamsheets?**

Streamsheets allocate a number of ports.

These are all used ports:

-   1883 - MQTT Broker
-   1884 - Internal MQTT Broker
-   8080 - Gateway
-   8081 - Reverseproxy
-   8083 - Streams Service
-   8088 - Gateway WebSocket API
-   8090 - Gateway HTTP API
-   9000 - WebUI
-   40000-40100 - Streams Service (UDP)
-   4840 - OPC UA
-   6379 - Redis
-   27017 - Internal MongoDB

**How can I change ports?**

Depending on your installed version, there are different ways to adjust
the ports.

**Open Source:**

Starting with version 1.5 of the Streamsheets open source release you
can add the port changes to the `docker run` command used in the
installation process:

`docker run  -p 8081:8081  -p 1885:1883  -v /tmp/db:/var/lib/mongodb  cedalo/streamsheets:1.5`

The parameter `-p port:port` defines the port allocation. In the example
above the 1883 port of the MQTT Broker was mapped to use the port 1885.
Add another `-p port:port` for every port that needs adjustment.

**Streamsheets Premium** (and Open Source versions older v1.5) **:**

If you don´t use the open source version or have an older version, the
port mapping is done via a .yml file in your Installer directory in the
"docker-compose" folder. To change each port individually open the .yml
file and search for the "ports" parameter of the service.

**Port Mapping:** The command and the .yml file always use the structure
*port:port* to adjust ports. This is because we map internal docker
ports to the ports of the host system. The port on the left represent
the port of the host system and the port on the right represents the
internal docker port. The one that interests you, is the one of the host
system.

Changing the port to 8082 would look like this:

> 8082:8081

**When do I need to change ports?**

Sometimes other programs are blocking certain ports. Then you encounter
error messages like this:

> *ERROR: for streamsheets-service-feeders Cannot start service
> streamsheets-service-feeders: driver failed programming external
> connectivity on endpoint streamsheets-service-feeders
> (3c98f65b49d5c5ad961c9fde5ef145f21bf385b5edc077e204a9b877834185be):
> Bind for 0.0.0.0:8083 failed: port is already allocated*

Changing either the port of the Streamsheets or the port of the other
program is then the only option, if you want to run both at the same
time on this host system.

## Mosquitto Broker

Streamsheets comes with the MQTT [Mosquitto
Broker](https://mosquitto.org/). The password will be randomly generated
on installation and set once in the standard "MQTT Connector".

**Find Password:** Within the Streamsheets installation directory in the
folder "settings" you can find the "mosquitto" folder. Open the
"pw\_clear.txt" file to access your password.

**Change Password:** To change the broker password stop Streamsheets,
delete the "pw.txt" & "pw\_clear.txt" file and restart again. The new
password will be generated and again written into the "mosquitto"
folder. Don´t forget to change the password in your Streamsheets
connector!
