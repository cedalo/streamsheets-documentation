# Streams

Streams can be found next to the App Dashboard in another Tab.

The Stream-resources `Consumer`s, `Producer`s and `Connector`s serve the
purpose of defining data streams. There is a hierarchy to these
resources in which Connectors form the foundation for Consumers and
Producers. Hence, the definition of a data stream consists either of a
Connector-Consumer pair or a Connector-Producer pair. Each Consumer and
each Producer runs on exactly one connector. Connectors, on the other
hand, can have many consumers and producers.

-   As the name suggests, Connectors take information on overall
    connection parameters, such as addresses and authentication details.
    Especially if several message streams are on a broker, server or
    other “data space”, Connectors contain information which can be
    shared by Consumers and Producers. Consequently, shared information
    has to be defined only once in one place.
-   Consumers are used to define the input message stream of
    Streamsheets. They are added to the Inbox of a Streamsheet
-   Producers are used to define outgoing message streams. They are
    referenced in stream functions like MQTT.PUBLISH().

In the following we will use MQTT as an example stream:

## Connector

A Connector is always the foundation of our communication architecture.
Consumer and Producer reference to a Connector and define the details.
The connector itself "connects" the Streamsheet to a provider, you can
choose from a preconfigured list. Once a provider is choosen, there are
a variety of settings, which can be applied to define the details of
your data stream.

### MQTT Connector

The MQTT Connector has the following possible settings.

-   **Name:** The Name of your Connector
-   **Provider:** you can´t change the provider. You choose it while
    creating the connector.
-   **URL:** Choose the MQTT Broke you want to use. If you want to use
    our own broker, which is hosted by the Stream Sheet Server, type in
    `broker`
-   **Port:** Choose the port you will be using to transfer the data.
-   **User Name & Password:** If your URL needs identification, you can
    type in your credentials. For local usage not neccessary.
-   **Base Topic:** The Base topic describes where the connector will be
    connected to.
-   **Retain Message:**
-   **QoS:** Stands for quality of service. You have the choice between:
    At most once, At least once, Exactly once.
-   **Protocol Versio:** MQTT Broker can run on different protocols.

## Producer

A Producer is used in a Function. It directs the data stream out of the
Stream Sheet. The Function together with the Producer defines where your
data will be heading. A Producer is always connected to a Connector,
which serves as the foundation of a Producer. Once the Connector is
choosen, there are some additional settings within the Producer.

### MQTT Producer

The MQTT Producer has the following possible settings:

-   **Name:** The Name of your Producer.
-   **Connector:** Choose the connected Connector.
-   **Data Format:** Choose the Data Format a Producer will publish the
    Messages in.
-   **Topic:** Extend the Base Topic of the Connector. The Message will
    be sent to the full topic branch defined through Connector, Producer
    and Function (ConnectorTopic/ProducerTopic/FunctionTopic).
-   **Clean:** turn on clean session
-   **Static Client ID:** set a static client ID if needed

## Consumer

A Consumer is always connected to the Inbox of a Stream Sheet. It
defines the details of the data stream comming into a Stream Sheet. A
Consumer is always connected to a Connector. Once the Connector is
choosen, there are some additional settings within the Consumer.

### MQTT Consumer

The MQTT Consumer has the following Settings:

-   **Name:** The Name of your Consumer.
-   **Data Format:** Choose the Data Format you wish to accept in the
    Inbox.
-   **Static Client ID:** set a static client ID if needed
-   **Topics:** Choose one or more topics the Consumer will listen to.
    The topics always extend the Connector Base Topic.
-   **Clean:** turn on clean session
