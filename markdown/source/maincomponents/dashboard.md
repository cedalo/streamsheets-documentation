as well change between a tile view and a list view. To add another App

to adjust the view of your Dashboard, switching between a tile view and
a list view. Every App comes with a default picture. This can be changed
in the settings of each App. The image ratio should be around 300x150px.

documentation and the other gives you the possibility to adjust your
personal settings, access the administration menu and information about
your current installation. On the top left you find another button
