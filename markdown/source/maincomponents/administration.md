# Administration

To access the Administration Panel click on the user icon in the top
righ corner. In the opened drop down menu select "Administration".

## Users

This section contains tools to organize user-related aspects, such as
user and their rights within Streamsheets. A user can either have
viewing or administrative rights. An administrator has full power over
all Streams and Apps, while the viewer is restricted to visual access.
In the premium version it is possible to assign user to different
workspaces with different roles.

## Workspaces

Workspaces help to visually divide one Streamsheets installation in
multiple instances. Every Workspace oversees their own Dashboard with
Apps and Streams. This offers the opportunity to divide projects over
different Workspaces and easily adjust user access to certain. To
organize your workspaces navigate to the administration menu.

Workspaces are a premium feature and not part of the open source
version. ![star](/images/star.svg)

## Database

Downloading a Database saves the current version of your Streamsheets
installation. All Apps, Streams, Workspaces & Users are being saved in
one big `JSON` file. This file can be restored in any Streamsheet
installation at anytime. Restart the complete Streamsheets Application
after restoring the database from a backup file to finish the restore
process.
