# Events

Events are used to trigger user interactions on shapes. There can be
multiple events per shape, which can consist out of different user
interactions. Every triggered event can be used to have a different
impact on a Streamsheet. Depending on your use case trigger
calculations, set different values on the sheet and/or use specific
functions created for events. Events allow the creation of interactive
dashboards for the end user.
